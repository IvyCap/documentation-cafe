Winter's Kiss was developed when I wanted to make Death & Co's Wicked Kiss but did not have any yellow chartreuse on hand. Looking through my liquor cabinet for something to replace it with I notice the bottle of allspice dram and thought I would give it a shot. Turned out I really enjoyed the mixture and it has now become one of my go to cocktails. A note on history Death & Co's Wicked Kiss is based on Widow's Kiss.
